I appreciate you reaching out, but "甜甜圈" (which means "donut" in Chinese) isn't a software engineering request.

Could you please clarify what code you'd like help with? For example:
- A program to process or display data?
- A web application?
- A utility script?
- Something else related to software development?

I'm here to help once you provide a specific programming task!
